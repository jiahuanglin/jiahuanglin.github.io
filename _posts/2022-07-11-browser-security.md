## Web page security
Let's hypothesize what the Web world would look like if there were no security policies on pages. The Web world is open, which is very much in line with the Web philosophy. But if the Web world were free, there would be no restrictions on-page behaviour, which would create a disorderly or chaotic situation with many uncontrollable problems. For example, if you open a bank site and then accidentally open a malicious site, without security measures, the malicious site can do many things:

- Modify the DOM, CSSOM and other information of the bank site.
- Insert JavaScript scripts inside the bank site.
- Hijack the user's login username and password.
- Read the cookies, IndexDB and others. You can even upload this information to your server to forge some transfer requests and other information without your knowledge.

So, in the unsecured Web world, we have no privacy, so we need security policy to protect our privacy and data security.
